Verification of some properties of a 4-way set-associative cache,
design taken from here:
https://github.com/airin711/Verilog-caches

The cache is word addressed with a 25-bit address. The block size is 128 bits = 4 words.
Therefore, the lower 2 bits are dedicated to the index.
The tag seems to be bits 22 through 14 (9 bits) for some reason.

Properties to check:
- Consecutively accessing an address causes a hit

- First access after reset is a miss
- After accessing 4 different addresses in the same way and then evicting one,
  the evicted block was the least recently used one
